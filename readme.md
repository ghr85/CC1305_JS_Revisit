## Week 13 Day 05
### Weekend Homework - Returning to JavaScript ES6 Syntax and Transpiling

#### Instructions

Review codebase from last JS Exercise and update to include ES6 classes, import/export references and object destructors. This is a prelude to React.

#### Notes

* Classes aren't really classes at all - they're syntactic sugar - similar to JSX in React. Makes it more human readable.

* Have a look at the updated examples for future reference the gist is that ` exports default className`

* Similarly for `import Classname from '../path'`

* Note that Node 4 doesn't play nicely with ES6 - you can't refactor server.js
